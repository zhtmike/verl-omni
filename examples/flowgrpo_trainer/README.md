# FlowGRPO Trainer

This example shows how to post-train `Qwen-Image` with FlowGRPO on an OCR-style image generation task using `vllm-omni` rollout and a visual generative reward model (`Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct` in this example).

For the full installation and quickstart guide, see `docs/start/flowgrpo_quickstart.md`. For algorithm details and rule-based reward training (e.g. JPEG incompressibility), see `docs/algo/flowgrpo.md`.

## Installation

Follow the [installation guide](../../docs/start/install.md) to set up the base environment, then install the FlowGRPO-specific dependency:

```bash
pip install Levenshtein
```

The provided script is configured for a single node with `4` GPUs.

## Prepare the dataset

Obtain the raw OCR dataset from the original Flow-GRPO repository:

- https://github.com/yifan123/flow_grpo/tree/main/dataset/ocr

Place the raw dataset under `$WORKSPACE/data/ocr` (where `WORKSPACE` defaults to `$HOME`), then preprocess it into parquet files:

```bash
python3 examples/flowgrpo_trainer/data_process/qwenimage_ocr.py \
  --input_dir $WORKSPACE/data/ocr \
  --output_dir $WORKSPACE/data/ocr/qwen_image
```

This produces:

- `$WORKSPACE/data/ocr/qwen_image/train.parquet`
- `$WORKSPACE/data/ocr/qwen_image/test.parquet`

## Prepare the models

**Policy model (Qwen-Image):** the script uses the Hugging Face Hub ID `Qwen/Qwen-Image` directly — no manual download is required. Hugging Face will cache the weights automatically on first run. To use a local copy instead, edit the `model_name` variable in the script directly.

**Reward model (Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct):** the script defaults to the Hugging Face Hub ID `Qwen/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct`, so no manual download is required — Hugging Face will cache it automatically on first run. To use a local copy instead, edit the `reward_model_name` variable in the script directly.

## Run training

Launch the example from the repository root:

```bash
bash examples/flowgrpo_trainer/run_qwen_image_ocr_lora.sh
```

Optional KL loss tuning:

- `actor_rollout_ref.actor.use_kl_loss=True`
- `actor_rollout_ref.actor.kl_loss_coef=0.001`

The script runs `python3 -m verl_omni.trainer.diffusion.main_flowgrpo` with:

- `algorithm.adv_estimator=flow_grpo`
- `actor_rollout_ref.model.path=Qwen/Qwen-Image`
- `actor_rollout_ref.model.lora_rank=64`
- `actor_rollout_ref.model.lora_alpha=128`
- `actor_rollout_ref.rollout.name=vllm_omni`
- `reward.custom_reward_function.name=compute_score_ocr`
- `trainer.n_gpus_per_node=4`

## Logging

W&B logging is enabled by default in the example script:

```bash
export WANDB_API_KEY=<your_wandb_api_key>
```

The script sets:

```bash
trainer.logger='["console", "wandb"]'
trainer.project_name=flow_grpo
trainer.experiment_name=qwen_image_ocr_lora
```

Override these values on the command line if you want to log under a different project or run name.

### Diffusion-specific metrics

See the [Metrics Documentation](../../docs/start/metrics.md) for a full description of all diffusion-specific training metrics.

## Variants

For reward models that are expensive to evaluate (e.g., a VLM judge), the reward model can be allocated its own dedicated GPU resource pool and run asynchronously alongside the policy. This avoids blocking policy training on reward computation.

```bash
bash examples/flowgrpo_trainer/run_qwen_image_ocr_lora_async_reward.sh
```

Ulysses sequence parallelism shards the sequence dimension across GPUs to reduce per-GPU memory. A ready-to-use 4-GPU SP=2 LoRA example is provided:

```bash
bash examples/flowgrpo_trainer/run_qwen_image_ocr_lora_sp2.sh
```

We have provided a script to enable non-cfg full-weight Qwen-Image OCR training. The example is runnable on 4 NVIDIA H200 GPUs; enabling CFG requires more GPU resources.

```bash
bash examples/flowgrpo_trainer/run_qwen_image_ocr.sh
```


## Performance

> All experiments were conducted on *NVIDIA H800* GPUs using the OCR reward.

The experiment settings and throughputs are shown in the table below.

> **Note:** Reward curves may differ from the references above mainly due to rollout-side stochasticity: diffusion rollouts sample random latents/noise, and the example scripts do not fix the data seed, so prompt ordering can vary between runs.
