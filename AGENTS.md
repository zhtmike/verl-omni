# Agent Instructions for verl-omni

> These instructions apply to **all** AI-assisted contributions to `verl-project/verl-omni`.
> Breaching these guidelines can result in automatic banning.

## 1. Contribution Policy (Mandatory)

### Duplicate-work checks

Before proposing a PR, run these checks:

```bash
gh issue view <issue_number> --repo verl-project/verl-omni --comments
gh pr list --repo verl-project/verl-omni --state open --search "<issue_number> in:body"
gh pr list --repo verl-project/verl-omni --state open --search "<short area keywords>"
```

- If an open PR already addresses the same fix, do not open another.
- If your approach is materially different, explain the difference in the issue.

### No low-value busywork PRs

Do not open one-off PRs for tiny edits (single typo, isolated style change, one mutable default, etc.). Mechanical cleanups are acceptable only when bundled with substantive work.

### Accountability

- Pure code-agent PRs are **not allowed**. A human submitter must understand and defend the change end-to-end.
- The submitting human must review every changed line and run relevant tests.
- PR descriptions for AI-assisted work **must** include:
  - Why this is not duplicating an existing PR.
  - Test commands run and results.
  - Clear statement that AI assistance was used.

### Fail-closed behavior

If work is duplicate/trivial busywork, **do not proceed**. Return a short explanation of what is missing.

## 2. Development Workflow

### Environment setup

```bash
# Install vLLM and vLLM-Omni rollout backend first
pip install "vllm==0.20.2" \
    "vllm-omni @ git+https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-omni.git@c7178d89bb7a70817f239febc84c3b21a714dae7"

# Install verl (latest main)
pip install git+https://github.com/verl-project/verl.git@main

# Install VeRL-Omni in editable mode
pip install -e .

# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### PR title format

Titles must follow `[{modules}] {type}: {description}`.

Valid modules: `vllm_omni`, `diffusion`, `omni`, `rollout`, `trainer`, `reward`, `model`, `algo`, `fsdp`, `ray`, `worker`, `data`, `cfg`, `ckpt`, `doc`, `ci`, `tests`, `docker`, `misc`.

Valid types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, `test`.

Add `[BREAKING]` prefix if the PR breaks any API (CLI arguments, config, function signatures).

### Commit messages

Add attribution using commit trailers:

```text
